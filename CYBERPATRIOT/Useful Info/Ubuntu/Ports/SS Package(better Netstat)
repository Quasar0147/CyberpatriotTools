The SS package can be used in specific manners, and is in fact better that other such packages. A useful syntax could be:
ss -o state established '( dport = :ssh or sport = :ssh )'
This finds all connections from SSH
SS is PRE-INSTALLED, and can be used easily
Notes: Did not use in script cause got NEARLY everything I need from netstat
