TCPDUMP can be used to see what activity is occuring in a port
Several Syntaxes:
tcpdump -i eth0
This lists ALL activity in your ENTIRE interface
tcpdump port 3389
Lists all activity on 3389

When observing a few items in scrutiny, -X will provide hex so you can see the packets
For example
tcpdump port 3389 -X
(Note:
Could be
tcpdump port -X 3389
Havent tested)
Above gives the PACKET info, so you can see what the heck is happening
